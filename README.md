## Use the starter code with Google Colab

To avoid the hassle of setting up the program environment, it is recommended to follow the following Google Colab link to complete the homework assignment:

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13h0oymRadJpfjEPyDbxZ8X3hQU6ySW0m?usp=sharing

This link shares a file 'HW3OnColab.ipynb'.

### Step 0: Preparation

Create a Google account and open the above link. When you finish this step, you will find the 'HW3OnColab.ipynb' file in your Google Drive.

### Step 1: Write your codes and upload them to your Google Drive

You should first implement the code functions specified in homework 3. Then, you can upload the folder 'starter_code_hw3' to your Google Drive.

### Step 2: Follow the instructions in the Colab file

I advise you to copy the shared 'HW3OnColab.ipynb' to your own Google drive. 

Now, you can start 'HW3OnColab.ipynb' in your Google Drive and follow the instructions in that file.



### Tip: edit your codes online

When you debug your codes in Google Drive, you can right-click your Python file in Google Drive and choose an editor in the 'Open with' list.
